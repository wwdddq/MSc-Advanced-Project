## Perception Maze: A Comparative Study of Human and Artificial Intelligence on the Perception of Authenticity in Artistic Images

Firstly, before we officially start reading the introduction, let's play a little game!

- Can you unveil the truth behind these images?

## Project Introduction

This project consists of two parts, the first part is the research question and the second part is the work. The work is presented as an interview form tool in the research question.

## Introduction to Research Topics

**A Comparative Study of Human and Artificial Intelligence on the Perception of Authenticity in Artistic Images**

With the advent of sophisticated artificial intelligence techniques, the understanding of the nature of image authenticity has reached a new frontier. As these techniques continue to evolve, particularly in the field of art, recognising what is real and what is artificially generated has become a key challenge. This thesis delves into the heart of this challenge, exploring the perceptual dichotomy between human cognition and GANs, particularly through the lens of the capabilities of StyleGAN3 discriminators and their interaction with human judgement.

The genesis of this research lies in a critical exploration of how technological advances (particularly in the field of AI image generation) are redefining the benchmarks of authenticity. It seeks to shed light on the subtle ways in which humans perceive and judge the authenticity of art images - an area where the human eye and AI intersect but diverge significantly.

In the sections that follow, the paper describes a mixed-method approach that combines rigorous quantitative analysis with insightful qualitative interviews to illuminate the multidimensional nature of image authenticity judgements. Thematic analysis of the interview data provides insights into the human factors that influence these judgements, while the findings provide empirical evidence of the differences between AI and human capabilities in this area.

The journey of this thesis runs through the intricate interplay between emotion, art and technological prowess, ultimately aiming to enrich the discourse on the role of AI in the arts and guide the development of more empathetic and culturally aware AI systems. Through this exploration, the thesis positions itself at the intersection of technology, art, and human perception, offering a unique perspective on evolving narratives of authenticity in the digital age.


## Introduction to the work

**Perception Maze**

In the age of artificial intelligence, how do we understand the reality of images? This work, as a key part of the research project, aims to explore this question in depth through an interactive experience. I seek to stimulate the viewer to think deeply about the authenticity of images, whilst exploring how humans can respond and adapt in the context of rapid technological advances. The work is more of a reminder to encourage the public to maintain a critical and discursive mindset in the face of an increasingly complex world of images.

The work consists of two parts: a physical display of printed images and an interactive digital image in the form of a game on the website. In the physical printed image section, through the use of a series of images generated by StyleGAN3 and facial portrait images of people from real paintings, it aims to challenge the viewer's judgement of what is real and what is not. The markers behind each image reveal its authenticity, giving the viewer the opportunity to rummage through and self-check. This is not just a visual adventure, but a profound reflection on self-perception and judgement. In the Digital Image Interactive session, the audience is invited to judge the authenticity of the images and provide instant feedback through an innovative website trivia game. This process is not only entertaining, but also demonstrates the human ability to discern the authenticity of images under current technological conditions.

This work not only enhances the interactivity of the interview format of the research project and the reliability of the information collected, but also invites the audience to step into this "maze of perception" to experience, explore and reflect on the authenticity of the images of our time.
