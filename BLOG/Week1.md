# Week1
The first week has been spent exploring the possibilities of my topic, watching a documentary recommended by my tutor, and reading some literature to get an initial idea of my project.

## 'HyperNormalisation'.

Some background derived from watching the documentary:

In today's cyberspace, where the dissemination of information is ubiquitous, our consciousness and the standards by which things are judged are influenced by both our own perceptions and the Internet. We tend to tend to believe the information presented on the Internet as objective facts. But behind this lies a subjectivity about how media and technology shape our views and influence our judgements. One of the most important media for information dissemination is images, and there are countless techniques for image generation in machine learning.

### Is everything connected?
The article explores the 2016 BBC documentary HyperNormalisation directed by Adam Curtis. Released a few days before the last presidential election in the US, the documentary tells the story of a conspiracy that has seen Western audiences living in a false reality crafted by power-hungry individuals since the 1970s.

The article points out that the documentary itself functions as a kind of conspiracy theory: by juxtaposing various images and archival footage in an almost surreal way, it claims that by following the connections-which can be reached in just a few clicks-we can fully comprehend the current state of affairs, from the Syrian civil war to Britain's exit from the European Union to Trump's election.

The article cites research by Susan Lepselter, who conducted an ethnographic study of the USAF's highly classified Area 51 and its correlation with evidence of the existence of UFOs. The article discusses why normally friendly, rational people would organise their lives around stories of aliens, secret government agents and destroyed livestock, and points out that real traumas and fantasies are real.Rather than discussing these traumas specifically, Curtis's documentary claims that the US Air Force itself is the source of conspiracy theories related to the airbase, aiming to divert attention away from military experiments during the Cold War attention.

The article also mentions how Curtis presents social analysis through a collage of internet browser tabs against established narratives of reality, and explores how social scientists resist such accusations and assert the difference between social analysis and a collage of internet browser tabs.

The article concludes by suggesting that through Actor-Network Theory and French pragmatist thought, we should shift our focus from the entities connected in the story to how they are connected. In Lepselter's analysis, the art of interpretation lies in connecting images in a way that places us at the centre of the chaos, rather than searching for hidden integrity behind or beyond the fragments.

This essay explores the restlessness and melancholy of the contemporary West and discusses this mood through Curtis's documentary as an object of study.

### Software Self Society: The Computer Histories of Adam Curtis
The article analyses in detail several works by British documentary filmmaker Adam Curtis, focusing in particular on the impact of computer technology on individuals and society. The following documentaries are discussed:

1. 'All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace' (2011): explores how computer and network technology has changed the way we see the world, particularly through the way various systems and networks are connected.

2. 'HyperNormalisation' (2016): analyses how the complexity of the real world is masked by power structures through the promotion of straightforward narratives, particularly in relation to political and social structures.

3. 'Can't Get You Out of My Head' (2021): discusses the impact of social media and online technologies on our lives and how these shape our understanding of self and society.

The article highlights how Curtis's work explores the social and psychological impact of computer technology through a cinematic approach and deep cultural analyses.Utterson notes that Curtis's documentary combines contemporary voice-over narration with historical archival footage to provide a unique perspective on the far-reaching political, philosophical, and social impact of computers and networked systems.

The article also discusses how Curtis reflects the complexities and challenges of modern society through the history of computers on film, particularly in understanding the broader theme of humans as part of software and society. In this way, Curtis's work is not just about the history of technology, but also seeks to explore and question our understanding of technology, society and self through the medium of film.

## Inspiration:
Misinformation - The Truth and Falsehood of Image Generation

## Some thoughts:
How do machines 'see' and 'misinterpret' the world?
Are image generation models misleading in image propagation?
Using adversarial attacks to discuss how images shape our views?

- Initial Thoughts
I would like to try to create a project to "mislead" a computer vision system through machine learning techniques. For example, producing artworks such as images that may look ordinary to the human eye, but are actually designed to trick computer vision algorithms into misclassifying or failing to accurately classify and recognise them. The final artwork may be presented by comparing the original sample with the counter sample, or by inviting the viewer to experience for themselves how the counter sample "fools" the machine vision model. Through this project, I try to explore and reflect on the reliability of technology and the diversity of artistic expression.


### Expanding associations:
People can be misled, but what about machines? - Differences in image perception between humans and AI.

This led to a preliminary proposal to "mislead" computer vision systems (CNNs) through machine learning techniques (image generation - GANs). After searching for relevant papers, I found that most of the relevant papers are about optimising the model through adversarial attacks. I would like to explore the reliability of the technique and the difference in perception between humans and machines through adversarial attacks.

### Problem:
I don't know which specific generative adversarial network model to choose for research, and the corresponding detection tools
