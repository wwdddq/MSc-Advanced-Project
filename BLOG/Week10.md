# Week10

## TA
When trying to use TA to categorise topics, I didn't quite understand exactly how I was going to categorise them, which made it difficult for me. So I went and searched the literature and how other people's studies have used TA as a method.

By reviewing the information and literature, I have come to the following conclusions:

Try to make connections between codes to form potential themes. Outlined a thematic 'map' to visualise how these initial themes fit together.

Revisited the coded data extracts to assess whether the identified themes accurately reflected the coded data and the dataset as a whole. Some themes were refined, merged, or separated to better express data insights.

Defined the scope and narrative of each theme. A detailed description was developed for each theme, outlining the aspects of the data it captured and the overall story it told in the context of the study.

Began drafting the analytical section of the report, weaving together the thematic narratives with appropriate data excerpts. Also began to link our findings to the wider literature and existing research in the field.

I tried to follow this step-by-step process to sort out the logic and slightly get my head around it again. Trying to start with 1. first impressions, understanding of AI, cues that influence judgement and also the medium.

The final analysis can be found in the paper.

## Questionnaire Analysis

As of this week I have received a total of 59 questionnaire results, although this is not a huge number for my research, I have used the 59 data as the basis for my analysis given that I still need to analyse the data.

I used python to perform a variety of analyses on the data from the questionnaires and created visualisations. Since my project is research in nature, documenting too much in a blog would be repetitive with the thesis, so please check out the details in the thesis.

The python data analysis code section can be found at the following link.
