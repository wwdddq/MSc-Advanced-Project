# Week9
Work objectives for this week: conduct character interviews, transcribe VCRs into scripts, and conduct initial coding analysis.

I invited four interviewees with different artistic backgrounds.

## Programme question design

**Q1**: What was your first impression when evaluating each image? What are some of the features as well that caught your attention? For example like the features skin texture. The hair or the accessories or the background, and then overall the lighting and shadows of this image, or the overall coordination.

**Q2**: Is there any one that you came across that you found particularly difficult to judge? And if so, what made you judge it wrong?

**Q3**: How would you rate your ability to recognise authenticity? On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate yourself.

**Q4**: Is there an image that will have contradictory points, for example you can see from this piece that he is particularly authentic, but from another place, you feel that it is as if it was generated. So how do you go about deciding that?

**Q5**: Do you believe that machine learning algorithms can do a better job than humans at assessing the authenticity of images. Why?

**Q6**: How do you usually tell the authenticity of some of the images that appear on the web. Because there is a lot of this misleading information on the web nowadays, including the big popularity of AI nowadays, a lot of images may have been generated. Have you ever encountered this situation and are you misled by this kind of information?

**Q7**: Do you feel that there is a difference in the way you feel about the images you see online and the photographs on paper, and how does this difference affect your judgeMEnt and understanding of the content of the images?

## Initial Code

I used word's dictation feature to convert the VCRs to scripts and initially encoded them by script correlation.

- The script can be found here: https://github.com/wwdddq/MSc-Advanced-Project/blob/main/Interview/Interview_Transcripts.pdf

Firstly, I spent a couple of hours going through the interview transcripts again. I've been highlighting and jotting down initial impressions that will serve as a precursor to more detailed coding. (This step went reasonably well.)

From the interviews with the four participants, I used an inductive helper to organise the discussion into 21 initial codes.

Begin the coding process by marking important statements and observations in the data. Create a list of initial codes, noting potential relationships between them. (This step was slightly more difficult, but I found potential relationships between statements and codes through literature given to me by my mentor.)

## TA
When trying to use TA to categorise topics, I didn't quite understand exactly how I was going to categorise them, which made it difficult for me. So I went and searched the literature and how other people's studies have used TA as a method.

By reviewing the information and literature, I have come to the following conclusions:

Try to make connections between codes to form potential themes. Outlined a thematic 'map' to visualise how these initial themes fit together.

Revisited the coded data extracts to assess whether the identified themes accurately reflected the coded data and the dataset as a whole. Some themes were refined, merged, or separated to better express data insights.

Defined the scope and narrative of each theme. A detailed description was developed for each theme, outlining the aspects of the data it captured and the overall story it told in the context of the study.

Began drafting the analytical section of the report, weaving together the thematic narratives with appropriate data excerpts. Also began to link our findings to the wider literature and existing research in the field.

I tried to follow this step-by-step process to sort out the logic and slightly get my head around it again. Trying to start with 1. first impressions, understanding of AI, cues that influence judgement and also the medium.

The final analysis can be found in the paper.
