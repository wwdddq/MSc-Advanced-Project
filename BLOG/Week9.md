# Week9
Work objectives for this week: conduct character interviews, transcribe VCRs into scripts, and conduct initial coding analysis.

I invited four interviewees with different artistic backgrounds.

## Programme question design

**Q1**: What was your first impression when evaluating each image? What are some of the features as well that caught your attention? For example like the features skin texture. The hair or the accessories or the background, and then overall the lighting and shadows of this image, or the overall coordination.

**Q2**: Is there any one that you came across that you found particularly difficult to judge? And if so, what made you judge it wrong?

**Q3**: How would you rate your ability to recognise authenticity? On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate yourself.

**Q4**: Is there an image that will have contradictory points, for example you can see from this piece that he is particularly authentic, but from another place, you feel that it is as if it was generated. So how do you go about deciding that?

**Q5**: Do you believe that machine learning algorithms can do a better job than humans at assessing the authenticity of images. Why?

**Q6**: How do you usually tell the authenticity of some of the images that appear on the web. Because there is a lot of this misleading information on the web nowadays, including the big popularity of AI nowadays, a lot of images may have been generated. Have you ever encountered this situation and are you misled by this kind of information?

**Q7**: Do you feel that there is a difference in the way you feel about the images you see online and the photographs on paper, and how does this difference affect your judgeMEnt and understanding of the content of the images?

## Initial Code

我使用word的听写功能将VCRs转换成脚本，并通过脚本的关联性进行初始编码。
