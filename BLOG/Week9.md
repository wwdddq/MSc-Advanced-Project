# Week9
Work objectives for this week: conduct character interviews, transcribe VCRs into scripts.

Write the methodology section.

I invited four interviewees with different artistic backgrounds.

In determining the format of the survey, my initial idea was to transform the questionnaire into an interactive web-based format, similar to a participatory game, in order to widen the scope and enhance participation.

I used Actor Network Theory (ANT) and Susan Lepselter's analyses mentioned in DÃ¡nyi (2017) to structure the interview format, especially when presenting experimental images using different media.ANT considers all elements, including non-human entities such as technology or media, to be "actors" in an action network "This means that any medium in which an image is displayed is more than just a conduit for information; it influences the sending and receiving of messages. With this in mind, I chose a variety of mediums to present the experimental images, exploring how different ways of viewing influence people's judgements about the authenticity of the images.

In contrast to ANT is Lepselt's analysis, which suggests that the art of perception lies in connecting images in a way that revels in the chaos, rather than merely seeking the hidden integrity behind the fragments. I liken this analysis to a puzzle game, using the questionnaire as a medium to act as a window through which one peers in an attempt to find overall meaning from the outside. In order to immerse people in the heart of this chaotic puzzle, in its disorder and complexity, I chose to present printed images of physical experiments in a disordered manner, observing how being at the centre of the puzzle's story altered their judgement of the image's authenticity.

The finalised interview format consisted of inviting people from different backgrounds to judge the printed images and conduct basic qualitative interviews before experiencing a web-based image game. Afterwards, I asked participants about the perceived differences between the two media presentations and how these differences affected their judgements and understanding of the content of the images.

## Programme question design

**Q1**: What was your first impression when evaluating each image? What are some of the features as well that caught your attention? For example like the features skin texture. The hair or the accessories or the background, and then overall the lighting and shadows of this image, or the overall coordination.

**Q2**: Is there any one that you came across that you found particularly difficult to judge? And if so, what made you judge it wrong?

**Q3**: How would you rate your ability to recognise authenticity? On a scale of one to ten, how would you rate yourself.

**Q4**: Is there an image that will have contradictory points, for example you can see from this piece that he is particularly authentic, but from another place, you feel that it is as if it was generated. So how do you go about deciding that?

**Q5**: Do you believe that machine learning algorithms can do a better job than humans at assessing the authenticity of images. Why?

**Q6**: How do you usually tell the authenticity of some of the images that appear on the web. Because there is a lot of this misleading information on the web nowadays, including the big popularity of AI nowadays, a lot of images may have been generated. Have you ever encountered this situation and are you misled by this kind of information?

**Q7**: Do you feel that there is a difference in the way you feel about the images you see online and the photographs on paper, and how does this difference affect your judgeMEnt and understanding of the content of the images?


## Initial Code

I used word's dictation feature to convert the VCRs to scripts and initially encoded them by script correlation.

- The script can be found here: https://github.com/wwdddq/MSc-Advanced-Project/blob/main/Interview/Interview_Transcripts.pdf

Firstly, I spent a couple of hours going through the interview transcripts again. I've been highlighting and jotting down initial impressions that will serve as a precursor to more detailed coding. (This step went reasonably well.)

From the interviews with the four participants, I used an inductive helper to organise the discussion into 21 initial codes.

Begin the coding process by marking important statements and observations in the data. Create a list of initial codes, noting potential relationships between them. (This step was slightly more difficult, but I found potential relationships between statements and codes through literature given to me by my mentor.)
