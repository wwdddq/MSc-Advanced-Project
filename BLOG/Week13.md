# Week13
This week is the final week in which I have been thinking about the content of the video, finalising the video script and copy, and editing and dubbing the video.
Also, the thesis and all the documents that need to be uploaded were organised and uploaded.

### "Perceptual Maze"

**Work description**.
In the process of exploring how the concept of image authenticity is being redefined in the age of advanced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). This work is derived from the form used for character interviews in my thesis. Through these interactive experiences, I hope to stimulate the audience to think about image authenticity, and to explore how human beings should adapt and take action against the backdrop of rapid technological advancement. It also aims to remind the public to maintain a critical and discursive way of thinking in the face of an increasingly complex world of images. The work is divided into two forms: one is a physical display of printed images and the other is an interactive digital image in the form of a website mini-game.
The physical printed image portion of the display consists of a series of carefully selected images designed to challenge the viewer's judgement of what is real and what is not. Each image is accompanied by a marker on the back that reveals its authenticity, providing the viewer with an opportunity to rummage through and self-check. It is not only a visual experience, but also a profound reflection on self-perception and judgement.
The interactive section of the digital image is presented through an innovative website mini-game in which the viewer is invited to judge the authenticity of a series of images. After each selection, the game provides instant feedback, pointing out whether the choice was correct or incorrect. The process is not only entertaining, but also reflects on how human beings are able to understand and discern the authenticity of digital images under current technological conditions.

### Video Script

Beginning
VISUAL: The screen slowly advances to show the game-playing interface of the ss interview.

Narrator:
"Every day, countless images jump between our eyes and the screen. But in this digital age, which are real moments and which are fictional phantoms?"

Research topic description:
VISUAL: Captions / images selected for the experimental dataset / runway-generated videos / interviews playing with snippets of physical images

Narrator:
"This is exactly the question I am exploring in my research: how do humans and machines distinguish between real and fake art images?
My research delves into a new definition of image authenticity in the age of advanced Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). She is divided into two parts, one of which is the research question and the other is the artwork in the form of art. The artwork is presented as a tool for the character interview part of the research.

Narrator:
I used StyleGAN3 discriminators to analyse and interpret image data, and conducted surveys and interviews on human perceptions of image authenticity.
This study not only explores the perceptual differences between humans and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in discriminating the authenticity of art-based images, but also sheds light on how humans adapt their perceptions and judgement criteria in the face of technological advances.

Technical approach and findings:
Visual: Recorded screen run of GAN's code, 200 images shown

Narrator:
In my research, I explored the behaviour of StyleGAN3's discriminator when evaluating image veracity and found that its output scores were different than expected. Through in-depth analyses of different datasets, I established a scoring threshold that effectively distinguishes the generated images from authentic artworks.
Out of these 200 images, I selected 10 images as a sample for the experiment.

Presentation of the artwork for the website mini-game:
VISUAL: Showing me playing the website trivia game

Narrator:
"While conducting character interviews, I created a mini-game. The game involves people encountering a series of images that challenge your intuition - is this real, or is it generated?"

Ending
Visual:?

Narrator:
This research and work seeks to stimulate deeper reflection on the authenticity of images, as well as to explore how humans should respond and adapt in the context of rapid technological advances.
The work is in part more of a reminder to encourage the public to maintain a critical and discursive mindset in the face of an increasingly complex world of images.
