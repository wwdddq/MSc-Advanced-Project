# Week6
After finalising the experimental images last week, this week I intend to start working on the questionnaire and website.

For the questions, I have referred to the visual cues used in the literature as previously mentioned.

For the creation of the website, I found a software that builds websites without code called Framer.

With the guidance of the tutorial, I made a prototype of the website step by step. Although I encountered many problems during the process, they were solved with the help of the tutorials I found online.

I arranged my experimental images in a chaotic manner and used runway to generate videos that mimic StyleGAN3-generated videos for the background section of the web game. (Because StyleGAN3 generated video is still a bit difficult for me.)

However, the detailed parts of the kinematics still need to be optimised, and the intention is to continue this next week.
